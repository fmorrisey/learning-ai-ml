### Day 1

Machine v Deep Learning
1. Deep learning
2. machine learning
3. Artificial Intelligence 

Flow
- Trad: inputs -> rules -> output
- ML: inputs -> output -> rules

ML is turning something into numbers and letting the program find patterns?

Why use ML? Find the rules for complex systems

What it is good for?
- Problems with long list of rules
- Continually changing env, learn new scenarios
- Discovering insights within large collection of data

Not good for?
- When you need explainability
- When trad approach is better, GML Rule 1
- When errors are unacceptable, modes are probabilistic / non-deterministic
- Rule based systems are non probabilistic / deterministic systems
- When you don't have much data

**ML v DL** (Generalized)
Use a mix of algos to solve the probelms
- ML 
	- Structured data, tables, Excel
	- Algo: Gradient boosted machine
	- Alog XGBoost
	- Referred to as shallow algos

- DL - Tensors convert this data to structured
	- Unstructured data
	- non standardized rows / columns
	- natural language, audio, video, images, etc
	- Algo: Nural Networks
	- referred to  as deep algos
	
**Focused on Neural Networks, fully connected N, and Convolutional NN**

**What are Neural Networks?**
A NN is just a function made of layers, with adjustable knobs (weights). Training = turning the knobs until the outputs match the answers you want.
- A stack of layers that turn inputs into outputs
- Turns data into predictions
- Process:
	- Inputs: A bunch of numbers you feed in
	- Layers: Transforms that mix and weight those numbers
	- Output: A prediction
- Neural terms:
	- Neurons: simple units that take inputs, do a small calculation, and pass output forward
	- Connections (weights): how strongly one neuron influences the next
	- Learning: adjusting weights (connections) until the network makes good predictions
